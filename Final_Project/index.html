        Grey's Anatomy is a popular American medical drama that first premiered on ABC in 2005. The show follows the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings at the fictional Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital) in Seattle, Washington. At the center of the story is Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo, who starts as an intern and later navigates the challenges of her medical career, complicated relationships, and family dynamics. Meredithâ€™s journey is intertwined with the lives of her colleagues, including Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), a renowned neurosurgeon who becomes her love interest, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a tough but caring attending surgeon.
